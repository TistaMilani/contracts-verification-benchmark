The contract has only the `f` function that performs an external call:
```
function f(address a) public {
    (bool s, bytes memory data) = a.call("");
}
```
The properties `call-revert` and `call-not-revert` should both fail since we cannot know if the call will fail or not: it depends on the called contract if it contains a fallback function or not.
