The contract has two functions `s` and `f`:

The `s` function takes a uint value and assigns it to the `x` variable.
```
function s(uint _x) public {
	x = _x;
}
```

The `f` function performs an external call to the fallback function of the contract at address `a` as the function signature is empty.
```
function f(address a) public {
    (bool s, bytes memory data) = a.call("");
}
```

This contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attack: an attacker can deploy a malicious contract that calls the `s` function of the vulnerable contract in the fallback function and modify `x` value.
