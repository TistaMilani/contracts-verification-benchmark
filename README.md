# Solidity SMTChecker Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the SMTChecker tool. SMTChecker is a
software verification tool that uses Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
solvers to check the correctness of Solidity smart contracts. It is integrated
into the Solidity compiler, making it a convenient and efficient option for
developers looking to ensure the reliability of their smart contracts. The
analysis in this repository aims to provide an overview of what the tool can
currently do and what it cannot. 

## What can SMTChecker do?

## What are the limitations of SMTChecker?
While SMTChecker is a powerful tool for verifying the correctness of simple
smart contracts, it does have some limitations. Some of the limitations
include:

- SMTChecker cannot handle non-linear arithmetic operations.
- y
- z

## Examples
The repository contains several examples demonstrating the capabilities and
limitations of SMTChecker in verifying software programs:

- x
- y
- z

Each of these examples includes a detailed explanation of how SMTChecker can be
used to verify the correctness of the program.
