    "name": "Social Recovery Wallet\n\nThis is a simplified version of [this](https://github.com/verumlotus/social-recovery-wallet/blob/main/src/Wallet.sol) contract by [@verumlotus](https://github.com/verumlotus).\n\nThe concept was popularized by [this](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html) article by Vitalik Buterin.\n\n",
    "specification": "This wallet can be used by the owner to make transactions by calling `the executeExternalTx()` function, by provinding the desired recipient contract/externally owned account (EOA), an ether value, and arbitrary data.\n\nIn case of lost private key, a recovery process can be initiated by a guardian. The guardian first calls `initiateRecovery()` with the address of the new owner, followed by a threshold number of guardians calling `supportRecovery()` with the new owner's address. Finally, any guardian can call `executeRecovery()` to change the wallet's owner.\n\nAdditionally, owners have the ability to manage guardians by removing compromised or malicious guardians. The owner initiates the removal process by calling `initiateGuardianRemoval()` with the hash of the guardian's address, which queues the guardian for removal after a 3-day delay. The owner then calls `executeGuardianRemoval()` after the delay, providing the hash of a new guardian's address to finalize the removal and add the new guardian. Alternatively, the owner can call `cancelGuardianRemoval()` to restore the guardian state.",
    "properties": [
        " the first owner is always the owner, in other words: the owner cannot change (should fail).",
        " the recovery can never happen (should fail).",
        " if an address `addr` has participated in a recovery, then `addr` is a guardian. Should fail in v1 because guardians can be removed.",
        "if number of guardian greater than or equal to the threshold has participated in the same recovery round, and selected the same new owner, then `executeRecovery()` will succeed and `owner == newOwner`.",
        "`executeRecovery()` will fail if not enough guardians have joined the recovery process."
    ]
