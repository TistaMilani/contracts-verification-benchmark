    "specification": "Crowdfund is contract a for conducting crowdfunding campaigns. It allows users to donate ether to a specified receiver within a certain timeframe. The contract ensures that the crowdfunding campaign is successful if the total donated amount reaches a predefined goal. Otherwise, donors can reclaim their donations after the donation period has ended.",
    "properties": [
        " cannot withdraw if the contract balance is less than the goal.",
        " if the contract balance is greater than or equal to the goal, then after the deposit phase the receiver can withdraw.",
        " the contract balance cannot increase after the end of the deposit phase. This property should always be false, since a contract can receive ETH when its address is specified in a coinbase transaction or in a `selfdestruct`.",
        " the only way to decrease the contract balance is by calling `withdraw()` or `reclaim()`.",
        " if the goal amount is not reached and the deposit phase has ended, a donor can make a reclaim.",
        " if the goal amount is reached after the deposit period, only the receiver can withdraw from the contract",
        " if the deposit period has ended, only `withdraw()` or `reclaim()` can be called."
